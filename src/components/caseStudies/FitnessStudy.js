            <p>
              After analyzing the data gathered from surveys, interviews,
              shadowings, I started building the personas and creating the user
              journey map.
              <br />
              <br />
              By doing the previous I got a more define idea of the main
              targets, it also helped me to always keep in mind the user’s needs
              and goals. Whenever I got stuck in the user flow I always went
              back and re-read it.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the creation of the user flow the main differences between
              trainer and trainees was their authority.

          <h3>Who doesn’t love good ideas?</h3>
          <div style={{ display: 'block', margin: '12px 0' }} />

          <p>
            One of the things I like to do the most is generating ideas with a
            team, for this workshop, I asked a couple of colleagues to help me
            with some exercises because I wanted to know how they would tackle
            the problems in their own way. I explained the purpose of this app,
            the challenge and lay down the problems found in our target
            audience. I wrote down the problems on top of the board so everyone
            could have a vision of the problems and started generating ideas,
            after a couple of minutes we stop and did dot voting.
          </p>

          <div style={{ display: 'block', margin: '42px 0' }} />

          <p>
            While creating all these ideas my colleagues kept asking questions
            that I didn’t think of or didn’t question the “why” of some of the
            problems. <b>We went back to Discovery and Define</b> to review them
            again, we compare them with the workshop ideas and modified the user
            flow.

            <h3>User testing...</h3>
            <div style={{ display: 'block', margin: '6px 0' }} />

            <p>
              One funny thing is that happened during user testing is that users
              really liked the feature about rewarding them after completing a
              challenge or goal.
              <br />
              <br />
              This idea was brought on the workshop as a form of engaging more
              with users and their network, I went back to Discovery and Define
              to verify if it was worthed to add.
              <br />
              <br />
              How it works it’s that you gain a new charm with every challenge
              or goal completed and the new charm will appear at the top of your
              screen, the charms will be saved in your profile collection and
              you can change them if you would like to.
              <br />
              <br />
              And I said it’s funny because I thought I was the expert on the
              topic and that little detail might be obvious for others but not
              for me, it wasn’t obvious until real users interacted with it,
              that’s why the user interviews are really important.

            <p>
            Once I got all the ideas and features set, I began iterating between 
            wireframing and the user flow. After we stop making changes to the user flow 
            I started to create the low fidelity design in whimsical to not enter into 
            details of the pixel-perfect design. Having all the low fidelity designs 
            I carefully worked to transform them into  High-fidelity designs in Sketch.

            <p>
            Working in this project has made me more aware of the importance of looking at things with new eyes, and how
            doing minimal things like; invite colleagues and stakeholders to take a look of your research of the things 
            discovered and really HEAR THEM OUT, and verify those ideas with the market. It changes the way of seeing the 
            information because when you heard a new idea is a new perspective, and sometimes we do not realize that it can 
            be a better experience until you research and test that idea.
